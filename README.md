> Works with **Claude Code** · **Codex** · **Gemini CLI** · **Cursor** · **Antigravity** · **Windsurf** · **OpenCode**

## Installation

```bash
# Skills CLI (recommended)
npx skills add gutomec/ai-public-arsenal@squads

# npm registry
npm install @gutomec/ai-public-arsenal

# Direct from GitHub
npm install github:gutomec/ai-public-arsenal
```

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for all options and the GitHub-first approach.

## Quick Start

After installing the `squads` skill, open your AI coding assistant and run:

```bash
# List all squads on your machine
*list-squads

# Create a new squad from scratch
*create-squad my-awesome-squad

# Validate a squad before running
*validate-squad my-awesome-squad

# Run a squad workflow
*run-workflow my-awesome-squad main-pipeline
```

Squads are discovered from two locations: `./squads/` (project-local) and `~/squads/` (global). Project-local takes precedence on name collisions.

## What Are Squads?

A squad is a team of AI agents that work together. You define the agents, their tasks, and how they pass work between each other — then run the whole thing with one command.

Think of it like a CI pipeline, but for AI work. A legal review squad might have an extractor pulling key clauses, an analyst flagging risks, a writer summarizing findings, and a validator checking everything. You define it once in YAML, and any project can use it.

Each squad is a directory with:

- **Agents** — specialized AI workers (markdown files with persona, tools, instructions)
- **Tasks** — specific work assignments with pre/post conditions
- **Workflows** — execution order (pipelines, parallel, DAG)
- **Schemas** — JSON Schema validation for agent outputs
- **Config** — coding standards, tech stack, settings

### Squad Protocol Engine v4

The `squads` skill is built around [SQUAD_PROTOCOL.md](skills/squads/SQUAD_PROTOCOL.md) — a single source of truth that defines how squads are structured, validated, and executed.

**What it does:**

- **Discovers** squads from `./squads/` and `~/squads/` using filesystem scan
- **Creates** squads with proper structure (agents, tasks, workflows, schemas)
- **Validates** squad integrity (structural checks, schema validation, dependency audit)
- **Activates** squads by registering their agents as available commands
- **Executes** workflows with state management, checkpoints, and resume
- **Upgrades** v1/v2 squads to v3/v4 with backward compatibility

**Runtime protections:**

- **Doom loop detection** — stops agents that keep producing identical output
- **Ralph loop retry** — when a step fails, retries with a fresh context instead of accumulated noise
- **Real validation** — checks outputs against JSON Schema (ajv) before passing to the next agent
- **Context compaction** — trims handoff data to prevent context window overflow
- **Filesystem collaboration** — large artifacts go to disk instead of through context
- **Execution traces** — records timing, I/O, retries, and failures per step
- **Self-verify** — agents check their own work before handing off
- **DAG workflows** — dependency-based execution, not just sequential pipelines

**Backward compatible** — v1 and v2 squads run without changes. New features are opt-in via the `harness:` block in `squad.yaml`.

## Squad Lifecycle Triggers

Squads can emit lifecycle events during execution. Triggers are opt-in per squad:

```yaml
# In squad.yaml
triggers:
  enabled: true
  display: inline    # inline | log | both
  events:
    squad: true      # squad start/end
    agent: true      # agent start/end
    task: true       # task start/end
```

Events are emitted as stream markers (structured HTML comments). Frontends that understand the format can render progress bars, flow graphs, and agent status indicators. Terminals just ignore them.

Set `display: log` to persist events to `.aios/squad-triggers/{squad}.jsonl` for offline analysis.

## Distribution
