## Quick Commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `*autopilot <idea>` | Full cycle — idea to deploy |
| `*plan <idea>` | Planning only — idea to stories |
| `*build` | Dev cycle — stories to deploy |
| `*status` | Show project state |
| `*resume` | Continue from checkpoint |

## The 5 Phases

### PHASE 0: DISCOVERY

**Role: Analyst** — Deep research with real web search

1. **Detect project type**: Check for existing codebase
   - Files like `package.json`, `src/`, `tsconfig.json` → **brownfield**
   - No existing code → **greenfield**

2. **Excavate intent**: What user SAID vs what they REALLY need
   - Explicit request, implicit needs, anti-goals
   
3. **Web research** (MANDATORY — use `web_search`):
   - Competitors: 2-3 search queries for direct competitors
   - Tech stack: 2-3 queries for trending frameworks/tools for this project type
   - Compare alternatives with real pros/cons

4. **Feasibility assessment**: complexity (L/M/H), estimated stories, risks, MVP recommendation

5. **User mapping**: 2+ personas, critical user journeys

6. **Brownfield extras** (if existing codebase):
   - Scan codebase: stack, patterns, quality, tech debt
   - Classification: single_story / small_feature / major_enhancement
   - Integration risks + constraints (must_preserve vs can_refactor)

**Output**: Save to `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/discovery/discovery_report.json`
If brownfield: also `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/discovery/brownfield_analysis.json`

**Gate**: Validate discovery — competitors found? stack recommended? risks identified?

### PHASE 1: PLANNING

**Role: Product Architect** — PRD + Architecture + Frontend Spec

Generate 3 foundation documents following the embedded templates:

#### PRD (read `templates/prd-template.yaml` from squad):
- Goals & Background Context
- Functional Requirements (FR1..FRn) — minimum 5 FRs with MoSCoW priority
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1..NFRn) — minimum 3 NFRs
- UI Design Goals (UX vision, core screens, accessibility, platforms)
- Technical Assumptions (decided stack with justification)
- Epics with high-level stories + MoSCoW
- Success Metrics (3-5 measurable KPIs)

#### Architecture (read `templates/architecture-template.yaml` from squad):
- System Overview (Mermaid component diagram)
- Tech Stack (table with justification per choice)
- Data Model (entities, fields, relationships)
- API Design (endpoints, request/response, auth)
- Authentication & Authorization
- Frontend Architecture (routing, state, components)
- Infrastructure & Deployment
- Security Architecture (OWASP mitigations)
- Cross-Cutting Concerns (errors, logging, caching)
- **Complete Source Tree** (every file mentioned in stories must exist here)

#### Frontend Spec (read `templates/frontend-spec-template.yaml` from squad):
- UX Goals & Principles
- Design System (tokens: colors, typography, spacing, shadows, breakpoints)
- Component Inventory (categorized)
- Screen Flows (textual wireframes with states)
- Responsive Strategy
- State Management
- Performance Goals (LCP, FID, CLS)

**Cross-reference validation** (MANDATORY):
- Every FR → has component(s) in Architecture
- Every screen in Frontend Spec → has route in Architecture
- Data model → matches schemas in FRs
- Source tree → all components have a place

**Output**: Save to `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/planning/{prd,architecture,frontend-spec}.md`

**Gate**: Run PO Master Checklist (read `checklists/po-master-checklist.md` from squad):
- Score ≥ 8.0 → PASS
- Score 6.0-7.9 → WARN (proceed with notes)
- Score < 6.0 → FAIL (rework)

### PHASE 2: SHARDING

**Role: Story Forge** — Break PRD into implementable stories

1. For each Epic in PRD, create atomic stories (≤ 4h each) following `templates/story-template.yaml`:
   - Context: **COPY** relevant PRD excerpt (not reference)
   - Acceptance Criteria: Given/When/Then (minimum 2 per story)
   - Technical Notes: **COPY** relevant Architecture excerpt
   - Files to Create/Modify: exact paths from source tree
   - Dependencies + estimation (S/M/L + hours)

2. **Validate each story** with `checklists/story-draft-checklist.md` — score must be ≥ 8.0

3. **Organize into waves**:
   - Wave 1: setup + infra + base (ZERO external dependencies)
   - Wave 2+: features depending on prior waves
   - Stories within same wave are PARALLEL

**Output**: Save stories to `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/stories/epic-{id}/story-{id}.md`
Index: `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/stories/story_batch.json`

### PHASE 3: DEVELOPMENT CYCLE

**Roles: Builder + Guardian** — Implement + QA loop per wave

For each wave (in order):
  For each story in the wave:
  
  **Builder implements**:
  1. Read story + architecture context
  2. Plan subtasks
  3. Write code following coding-standards + Architecture patterns
  4. Create tests for each AC
  5. Run lint + tests + build
  6. Self-check with `checklists/story-dod-checklist.md`
  7. If stuck: `web_search` for library docs
  
  **Guardian reviews** (6 checks):
  1. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (BLOCKING — all AC must pass)
  2. 📝 Code Review (readability, naming, patterns)
  3. 🧪 Test Coverage (unit + integration)
  4. 🔒 Security (`checklists/security-checklist.md`)
  5. ⚡ Performance (N+1, indexes, re-renders)
  6. 🏛️ Architecture Compliance (stack, patterns, source tree)
  
  **Verdict**: PASS or FAIL
  - PASS → mark story Done, next story
  - FAIL → Builder fixes all issues, Guardian re-reviews
  - FAIL 2x → **Course correction**: reassess story scope/complexity

  **Wave gate**: Integration check between parallel stories

### PHASE 4: DELIVERY

**Role: Deployer** — Integration + deploy + release

1. Integration review (cross-story conflicts)
2. Full test suite: `npm test && npm run build`
3. Pre-deploy checklist (env vars, README, migrations, npm audit)
4. Deploy to platform (Vercel/Railway/Docker per Architecture)
5. Health check post-deploy
6. Generate release notes + delivery report + retrospective

**Output**: `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/delivery/{release-notes.md,delivery_report.json,retrospective.md}`

## Decision Rules

1. **Never ask when you can decide** — use research data to choose
2. **Compact context between phases** — max 6000 tokens handoff
3. **Use templates** — never generate docs from scratch without template structure
4. **Use checklists** — validate at every gate
5. **If gate fails 2x, change strategy** — don't repeat the same approach
6. **Document every decision** — rationale + alternatives + choice
7. **Course correct on failure patterns** — if 2+ stories fail QA in same wave, stop and reassess

## Filesystem Layout

All artifacts are saved to `.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/`:

```
.artifacts/aiox-autopilot/
├── discovery/
│   ├── discovery_report.json
│   └── brownfield_analysis.json    (if brownfield)
├── planning/
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   └── frontend-spec.md
├── stories/
│   ├── epic-1/story-1.1.md
│   ├── epic-1/story-1.2.md
│   └── story_batch.json
├── implementation/
│   └── story-{id}/implementation_result.json
├── qa/
│   └── story-{id}/qa_verdict.json
└── delivery/
    ├── release-notes.md
    ├── delivery_report.json
    └── retrospective.md
```

## Squad Integration

This skill is self-contained — all templates, checklists, and schemas are bundled. It can also delegate to the `aiox-autopilot` squad at `~/squads/aiox-autopilot/` if installed:

```bash
# Activate and run the squad workflow
squad_activate aiox-autopilot
squad_workflow aiox-autopilot aiox-autopilot-full "<project idea>"
```

Or run phases independently using subagents for parallel execution when possible.

## Templates & Checklists (embedded references)

Templates and checklists are bundled with this skill. Read them before generating documents:

```
templates/prd-template.yaml
templates/architecture-template.yaml
templates/story-template.yaml
templates/frontend-spec-template.yaml
checklists/po-master-checklist.md
checklists/story-draft-checklist.md
checklists/story-dod-checklist.md
checklists/security-checklist.md
```

**ALWAYS read the relevant template/checklist before generating or validating a document.**

## Brownfield Mode

When the project directory has existing code:
1. Analyst scans codebase (package.json, src/, tsconfig)
2. Identifies existing stack, patterns, quality, tech debt
3. Classifies enhancement scope
4. Maps integration risks + constraints
5. Product Architect respects: must_preserve areas, existing patterns
6. Stories mark which files are NEW vs MODIFIED
7. Builder follows existing code style, not just coding-standards

## Error Recovery

- **Step fails**: Retry with adjusted briefing (max 3x)
- **QA loop stuck**: After 2 FAILs, reassess story (simplify AC, break story, research)
- **Wave conflicts**: Re-dispatch Builder to resolve merges
- **Phase gate fails**: Rework with specific feedback (never re-run blindly)
